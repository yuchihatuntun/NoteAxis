Although I'm a designer, I've always felt that drawing icons is quite troublesome - they need to be standardized, concise, precisely express meaning, have design sense, and also meet massive quantity demands. Especially for time-pressed projects, icon production is a tedious and energy-consuming task.

Fortunately, open-source contributors upholding internet open-source culture have contributed many excellent open-source projects, allowing us to directly use these quality results. Below I'll share 14 quality icon libraries from my daily collection, basically covering all icon types, each with different advantages - like supporting React, Vue, Svelte and other common development frameworks, freely adjustable lines, colors, sizes and other details, providing Figma source files and various other needs.
